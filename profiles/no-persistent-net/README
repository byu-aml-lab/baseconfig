(note by Paul)
Andrew McNabb was strongly opposed to (annoyed by) the new persistent naming scheme 
for network interface names introduced by biosdevnames and udev, so he disabled it 
using this profile. Read more about the issue here: 
(http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/). 

This profile is in charge of disabling all services that alter network device 
names so that the typical names (e.g., "eth0", "eth1") are used.
If somebody wants to update all scripts that refer to eth0 and eth1 in the future,
then they can get rid of this profile. They will need to put especially careful 
thought into the firewall profile.

You would think this change would be very simple. However, the way to disable 
persistent naming has changed and gotten more complicated over a number of releases, 
which is why the scripts here do so many things.
