    # From the kickstart documentation:
    # BOOTIF command line option will be used to locate the boot interface.
    # BOOTIF is automagically supplied by pxelinux when you include the option
    # 'IPAPPEND 2' in your pxelinux.cfg file
    # Also note that the sshd option makes Anaconda start an ssh daemon for
    # remote access during the installation process.
